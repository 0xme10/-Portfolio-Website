# [My Portfolio](https://alixmohammed.com/)

This is a lightweight, single-page personal porfolio website to display a little bit about me. It was built using ReactJs and CSS. It contains information about the skills I have aquired along with some example projects that I have made.

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts Used:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
